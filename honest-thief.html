                    They call him the In and Out Bandit because meticulous thief Tom Carter (Liam Neeson) has stolen $9 million from small-town banks while managing to keep his identity a secret. But after he falls in love with the bubbly Annie (Kate Walsh), Tom decides to make a fresh start by coming clean about his criminal past, only to be double-crossed by two ruthless FBI agents. From the
                    co-creator of Emmy-nominated series Ozark, thriller Honest Thief showcases Liam Neeson in a heartfelt tale of redemption, packed with fights, chases and explosions centered on one man's mission to make things right for the sake of love.

                    <p>
                      Sneaking around Boston for years, Tom (Liam Neeson) has become a master thief, earning the nickname the "In-and-Out Bandit" for his slick ways when it comes to stealing large amounts of money. When he meets Annie (Kate Walsh), a psychology graduate student working at a storage unit facility, his heart melts, commencing a relationship that lasts a year before he's ready to
                      commit to something more. Ready to turn himself in to the FBI in exchange for a short sentence, Tom also wants to live peacefully with Annie. The feds don't immediately believe Tom is the In-and-Out Bandit, with Agent Baker (Robert Patrick) blowing him off, sending underlings to conduct an interview with the criminal. When Agent Nivens (Jai Courtney) and Agent Hall (Anthony
                      Ramos) are sent in to see if Tom is a real thief, they are led to boxes of money that challenge their dedication to duty. Electing to take the cash for themselves and murder Tom, the agents' plan is soon disrupted by the suspect's particular set of skills, watching him escape into the city to protect Annie while they scramble to cover their tracks as Agent Meyers (Jeffrey
                      Donovan), their superior, gets involved in the hunt. Tom ambushed Agent Hall in his home, and convinced him to give up the security footage at the storage company which would incriminate the agents, and the location of the safe house where the money was kept. After blowing up Agent Nivens' house while deliberately sparing his life, he followed Nivens to the safe house, knowing
                      that Nivens would try to make a run with the money. A gunfight followed at the safe house where Hall was killed and Tom was wounded. Nivens tried to drive away with the money, but he was intercepted by Tom's threat to detonate the bomb if he continues driving or attempts to leave the vehicle. Bomb squad arrives and attempts to defuse the bomb, only to find out that there is no
                      detonator and the bomb is impossible to explode. Nivens is arrested by the feds. Agent Meyers receives a voice recorder which recorded the conversation between Nivens and Hall before the gunfight at the safe house, proving Tom's innocence in the death of Agent Baker. Tom turns himself in, and Meyers promises to try to get a lighter sentence for Tom.

                        An entertaining thrill ride through and through, Honest Thief may look like a generic action flick at first glance, but surprisingly- due to Neeson's terrific performance and a decent script, this film actually has some heart. I am not a huge Liam Neeson fan, I have absolutely nothing against him, I have just never been one for his type of movies. Thus, I ended up seeing this
                        flick due to lack of options, and surprisingly I was very amused, and very delighted to see how truly good and charismatic Neeson can be on screen. He's, for lack of better words, a total bada** on screen- and I find his performance as well as several others throughout the film, a large driving force in what makes it so good. Kate Walsh also provides a good performance, as
                        well as Jai Courtney, and Jeffrey Donovan. The action scenes are very well choreographed, none of that shaky cam crap that makes me anxious to even think about, and the cinematography in general is very grounded- which is a nice change of pace for this kind of film. The script certainly has some familiar, or even generic elements to it, but once you continue to follow this
                        story, you truly start to feel for the characters and the situations they are involved in. It isn't just well written do its rounded characters, but it is truly made with passion and heart, which I adore in any film, especially in one with such dire circumstances as this one. In the end, Honest Thief is more than an enjoyable way to spend your time at the movies. Go see it if
                        you can, its at least one of the better films out right now, and please support your local theaters. Luckily my showing of the film had quite a few people in it, theaters really need the help, and may soon go extinct without help, and Liam Neeson seems like a good way as any to help save them.

                        I like Liam Neeson but I wasn't excited for Honest Thief. Oddly enough Honest Thief was released here in Canada last week but the Americans had to wait an extra week. I seen the film today since I had another free pass. Honest Thief was okay as expected.The acting was good including Jai Courtney whom plays the villain. Neeson was good but some people may feel he phoned it in.
                        The characterization was fine, you know enough to be invested.The plot is generic, you know what's going to happen from beginning to end. There's nothing surprising or clever. It's like the writers are rookies. The film is briskly paced, it's not slow like the Ryan Gosling movie Drive although it's better.Keep in mind Honest Thief isn't a straight up action movie like the
                        Taken movies. The action scenes are fine, they're not boring. They were shot and edited normally. The director is a rookie for action so he could improve.Honest Thief was okay, it's another generic thriller. It's one of those movies you watch only once or twice. If you like Liam Neeson, see it.
