                  <p>
                    Sixth-grader Peter (Oakes Fegley) is pretty much your average kid--he likes gaming, hanging with his friends and his beloved pair of Air Jordans. But when his recently widowed grandfather Ed (Robert De Niro) moves in with Peter's family, the boy is forced to give up his most prized possession of all, his bedroom. Unwilling to let such an injustice stand, Peter devises a series
                    of increasingly elaborate pranks to drive out the interloper, but Grandpa Ed won't go without a fight. Soon, the friendly combatants are engaged in an all-out war with side-splitting consequences. Based on the award-winning book by Robert Kimmel Smith, The War with Grandpa is a hilarious family comedy featuring an all-star supporting cast: Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, Rob
                    Riggle, Cheech Marin, Laura Marano and Jane Seymour.

                    <p>
                      After accidentally stealing from a grocery store due to having trouble with the self-checkouts and causing a scene with one of the workers, recently widowed Ed (Robert De Niro) is visited by his daughter Sally Decker (Uma Thurman), who wants him to move in with her family. Ed does not want to leave his house because he built it himself. Sally convinces Ed to move in with her
                      nonetheless, and gives him her son Peter's (Oakes Fegley) bedroom. Peter is not happy about giving his room to his grandfather and being moved to the attic. Ed is welcomed by Sally's husband Arthur (Rob Riggle) and two daughters, Mia (Laura Marano) and Jenny (Poppy Gagnon). During his first day moved in, Ed spends most of his time in his new room, sitting in his chair and
                      looking at the sky, still thinking about his late wife.<br /><br />Peter then tells his friends about his grandfather moving in with his family and living in his room. After a miserable first night in his new room, Peter decides to declare war. Ed agrees to war, as long as they follow the agreed upon rules of engagement: they cannot damage other people's belongings and cannot
                      tell the family about this. Peter pulls a series of pranks, including replacing Ed's shaving cream with quick-drying foam and damaging his record player. Ed gets back at Peter with pranks including removing the screws from all of Peter's furniture and rewriting his school report. Ed turns to his friends Danny (Cheech Marin) and Jerry (Christopher Walken) for some advice. Over
                      time, Ed begins to spend time with his granddaughters and son-in-law and learns how to use modern technology, such as self-checkouts and apps.<br /><br />Sally learns that Mia is dating a boy named Russell, who she does not approve of. Ed invites Jerry, Danny, and Diane (Jane Seymour) (a store worker that Ed befriended) to play dodgeball against Peter and his friends. Peter
                      and his friends win the first round, but Ed and his team manage to beat them during the second round. However, during the third round, Danny's jaw is injured; as a result, the game is declared a tie. Later, Peter pushes the button on Ed's emergency call necklace, and Ed picks Peter up from school to take him fishing. The two discover that it is illegal to fish there. Ed then
                      takes Peter to his old house and explains that he left some secrets in the walls.<br /><br />Ed learns that Peter is being bullied, so he, Danny, and Jerry throw the bully in a dumpster. At Jenny's Christmas-themed birthday party, Peter keeps his promise about not pulling any pranks. Peter rigs up an ejector seat for Ed, who is supposed to be playing the part of Santa that
                      night. Unfortunately, a last-minute change results in Jerry being dressed up as Santa. Throughout the party, Peter and Ed are asked to help out. Instead, they continue to prank each other, including spraying bottles at each other and Peter plugging the cord to the lights as Ed checks them, electrocuting Ed. As a result of their hijinks, they inadvertently reveal their war
                      with each other to everyone. Jerry gets ejected from his chair, resulting in further property damage and injuries to multiple guests. Ed is injured and taken to the hospital.<br /><br />As punishment, Arthur and Sally place Peter and Mia under "work arrest" for six months. Russell shows up; Sally initially seems angry at him, but instead welcomes him. Sally goes to pick up Ed
                      from the hospital, but learns that he has already checked out and his brother Chuck brought him to his old house. Peter decides to make amends, and begs Ed to move back in with the family. The two finally reconcile, as Sally listens. As time passes, Ed and Peter seem to finally be getting along until Ed leaves one day to be with Diane who are now in a relationship. Peter
                      looks on angrily, declaring a war on both them as the they leave.

                        Robert De Niro has done just about every kind of movie in his lengthy career. His latest, The War with Grandpa, is a family comedy which falls on the polar end of the spectrum from last year’s heavy hitters The Irishman and Joker. His character, Ed, is at that point where he shouldn’t be living by himself anymore. His daughter Sally (Uma Thurman) basically forces him to move
                        in with her family. Oakes Fegley plays grandson Peter who is forced out of his room and into the attic when Grandpa Ed moves in. Peter is not too happy about this and declares an all-out war with his grandpa in order to get his room back. They label their conflict as “Secret warrior versus senior soldier”<br /><br />Now it may be easy to dismiss this film and think back to
                        older heavier De Niro movies but there is a need for these types of broad family comedies especially in 2020. It’s a treat to see actors like De Niro, Uma Thurman, and Christopher Walken have so much fun doing a family comedy.<br /><br />With this war between grandson and grandpa, the movie comes with the Home Alone style pranks as Oakes Fegley booby traps his house hoping to
                        catch De Niro off guard. De Niro also gets in on the pranks with his buddies Cheech Marin and Christopher Walken. Then there’s Rob Riggle as Pete’s dad who ends up being the victim of some of the pranks. All of the antics provide the film with some easy laughs that will certainly leave kids howling, and adults may even find themselves enjoying it too especially at the hands
                        of Rob Riggle and Uma Thurman.

                        Not to be confused with 2016's Dirty Grandpa, which also starred Robert De Niro as a feisty senior, The War with Grandpa is a much gentler proposition. A throwback to the goofy Disney family comedies of the 1960s, the title is the plot, as doddery Grandpa (De Niro) moves into his daughter's (Uma Thurman) family home, which displaces her son Peter (Oakes Fegley) from his own
                        bedroom. Peter declares war; Grandpa retaliates, and soon the tit-for-tat escalates (Grandpa's shaving cream swapped for foam sealant; Peter's bed booby-trapped). Wily old Grandpa also has a secret weapon: his own gang of ancient homies (Christopher Walken, Cheech Marin) to provide strategic backup. Yes, it's a ridiculously starry cast for a film this slight, but everyone
                        involved is serious about making the broad physical comedy work. The result is that no matter how perfunctory the subplots, improbable the action sequences and corny the humour, the feel-good wins through. And, praise be, De Niro's almost entirely abandoned the comedy gurning!
