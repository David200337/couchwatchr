                <h2>Dacre Montgomery</h2>
                <p class="actor-birth">Perth, Australia, November 22, 1994</p>
                <p class="actor-description">
                  Dacre was born in 1994 in Perth, Western Australia. His mother is Australian-Canadian and his father is a New Zealander. At the time of his birth both of his parents were working in the film industry and he spent many hours during his childhood on film sets where he developed a love of acting. At the age of 10 he had his first role as an extra in a short film and decided that he
                  would pursue a career as an actor. He began comprehensive acting classes at the age of 12 with a local training school and also with a theatre company and throughout this period was often working in advanced class groups where he was exposed to working and training alongside young adults. Dacre was accepted into a specialist visual and performing arts program after a competitive
                  audition process when he entered Mount Lawley Highschool. Throughout his high school years he took part in many school productions and also attended acting workshops at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA) located at the Edith Cowan University campus in Perth. When Dacre graduated from high school he received an "Oscar" statuette after having been nominated
                  the best actor at the school during his 5 years there and he became determined to successfully audition to enter the Bachelor of Performing Arts program at the prestigious Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts. Dacre has always admired Hugh Jackman, who graduated from WAAPA and lived in Perth during his years at University. He has also has great admiration for Heath
                  Ledger, who grew up in Perth and who inspired him to believe that he too could make it all the way to Hollywood. After a grueling audition process Dacre was accepted into WAAPA to undertake his 3 year Bachelor of Arts in Acting. He graduated with his degree in 2015 on the day of his 21st birthday and knew within weeks that he would be filming 3 projects (A Few Less Men, Safe
                  Neighbourhood and Power Rangers) over the next 6 months.
