                    <p>
                      Tom Cooper, a mentally unstable man, invades the home of his ex-wife and kills her and her boyfriend before setting the house on fire, then drives away as the house explodes.<br /><br />Rachel Hunter, a newly-divorced single mother living in New Orleans, drives her 15-year-old son Kyle to school. While driving, Rachel gets stuck in rush hour traffic, and honks at a pickup
                      truck that has failed to go after the light has turned green. The owner of the truck, Cooper, soon catches up to Rachel and apologized for not promptly moving when the light turned green. The exchange escalates after Rachel tells her son Cooper to just ignore the man and refuses to apologize. A chase ensues before Rachel loses the man and is able to drop Kyle off at
                      school.<br /><br />Cooper tracks her to a gas station and steals her phone while she is inside. A frightened Rachel gets help from a customer who accompanies her back to her car but Cooper rams him with his truck and pursues Rachel in another chase before she is able to lose him again. When Rachel tries to contact her friend Andy, a divorce lawyer, for help, she finds that
                      Cooper has used the daily planner in her phone to locate Andy and brutally killed him in the diner where they were supposed to meet. Cooper continues to stalk and harass Rachel. He attacks her brother Fred in his house and kills Fred's fiancé, Mary. Cooper then sets Fred on fire just as police arrive at the house. They manage to shoot Cooper in the shoulder but he still
                      escapes. Cooper then catches up with Rachel again on a highway.<br /><br />Rachel and Kyle are pursued to her mother's old house, where Kyle hides inside. Cooper attacks Rachel in the driveway and goes into the house to find Kyle. As Cooper almost strangles Kyle to death, Rachel picks up a pair of scissors and stabs him in the eye with it; she then kicks Tom in the face,
                      impaling the scissors deeper and finally killing him. Rachel finds out that Fred had survived the attack and was in the hospital. After providing statements to the police, Rachel and Kyle leave to go and see Fred. As they drive away, a car cuts across Rachel and she almost honks her horn at the driver, but decides against it after what they have been through, to which Kyle
                      simply responds, "Good choice."

                      <p>
                        When it comes down to it, movies with a simple premise that aims to please an audience for 90 minutes usually succeed in doing so. A screenplay would really have to be terrible in order for a movie like that to fail. Now playing in theatres, Unhinged is precisely the type of thriller that aims to grab an audience and give them a fun time at the cinema for a short period of
                        time. This film won't be winning any awards, that's for sure, but I'd be lying if I said you won't get any enjoyment out of it. Here are my thoughts on Unhinged. The overall premise isn't much to write home about. Following a confrontation with a man in traffic, Rachel (Caren Pistorius) and her son Kyle (Gabriel Bateman) soon find themselves to be the target of road rage.
                        Stopping at nothing to utterly destroy their lives, emotionally and physically, this man begins to get a little too clever for his own good. A movie as short and as simple as Unhinged is, you need performances that will take the movie to another level. Russell Crowe is absolutely the reason to see this one. Over the last few years, unless you're talking about either Boy
                        Erased or The Nice Guys, Crowe really hasn't had his time to shine. I believe he was well aware of the type of film he was making here because he's completely devoted to this character. He knew he just wanted to give audiences a good time. His performance alone is what made the film worth watching as a whole. With that said, even though the rest of the cast was quite good,
                        their characters nearly ruined the film for me. For anyone who watches this film and looks at it from a logical point of view, you can pick it apart for days. The film itself plays out very enjoyably, but these are some of the dumbest characters I've seen in a film in a while. Most thrillers try and work around conveniences, but Unhinged doesn't even attempt to on most
                        occasions. From hardly ever involving the police to extras not even caring about a murder that has taken place clearly right next to them, there are a lot of glaring issues. Still, most viewers will look past these things, which I was able to do as well, but they were very much at the forefront and present throughout the entire duration. In the end, Unhinged is the perfect
                        movie to kick back at the movies and have a fun, disposable time with. I wouldn't say it's anything worth running out to immediately see, but it's worth a rental. This is the widest release film that director Derrick Borte has helmed and I actually hope that I see more from him in the future, because he does have talent behind the camera for sure. In addition to Crowe's
                        committed performance, I actually found myself sucked in by the sound design. The way the sound effects were places felt like it helped immerse you in the midst of the chaos ensuing. This film is littered with issues and it absolutely shows in the final product, but it's still a fun watch. I give Unhinged a mild recommendation.
